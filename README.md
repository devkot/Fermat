Simple project developed for Intro to Programming course in University of Athens. 

It is written in C and uses both a deterministic and probabilistic algorithm while showing the results of the different methods used.
The range of numbers checked is between 1990000001 and 2000000000 and execution time is approximately 42 seconds for the deterministic
algorithm and 7-10 for Fermat's probabilistic algorithm. Totally, there are 10 tries to prove the difference in efficiency when such
an algorithm is used. Also, as the number tries increases so the primes found are also reduced  while also increasing execution time.
The reason for this change in the results is because of the numbers known as Fermat Liars.
